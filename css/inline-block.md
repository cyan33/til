# Recap the Difference Among Inline, Block, Inline-Block

`inline`: An inline element will accept margin and padding, but the element still sits inline as you might expect. Margin and padding will only push other elements horizontally away, not vertically.

`inline-block`: An element set to inline-block is very similar to inline in that it will set inline with the natural flow of text (on the "baseline"). The difference is that you are able to set a width and height which will be respected.

`block`: Block level elements do not sit inline but break past them. By default (without setting a width) they take up as much horizontal space as they can.
