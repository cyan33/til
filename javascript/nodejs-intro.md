# The Intro to Node.js

In short, Node.js is JavaScript at back-end. It's awesome in its own ways. At this point, I think every front-end developer, even web developer, should learn more or less about Node, because it lets you understand better about `callback`, `stream`, `module` and other kind of stuff.

To start to learn Node.js, I assume you are already quite comfortable with JavaScript itself. If you're not, you could still go on to read, but feel free to learn at least the basic of it. It's an awesome programming language:)

In this article, I'll keep updating the resources that I have been taking advantage of during learning Nodejs.

About this introduction, I get inspired mostly from [the-art-of-node](https://github.com/maxogden/art-of-node), which is a super awesome nodejs introduction. And this article may seem like a miniature, or summary of it, as you may call.

## Core

The core concepts of Node are `callback`, `event`, `stream`, `module`(for both `npm` and its workflow(`CommonJS`)).
