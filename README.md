It's always rewarding to write down some thoughts. Writing blogs could be time-consuming. So, inspired by @jbranchaud, I have found a new way to summarize and share knowledge with you guys.

The catogories below could vary a lot from Front-End development, to the abstract thoughts pattern, or even to general life-living tips. Feel free to leave your thoughts or comments by opening an issue.
