# File Navigation and Exploration

I am reading the book *The Linux Command Line*, so this might seem like a short summary:

## File Navigation

`ls` - list the files under your current folder
`pwd` - print the current working directory
`cd` - change directory

* absolute path
* relative path

## Exploring the System

`file` - determine the file type
`less` - view file content

`cp` - copy and paste file or directory
`mv` - move/rename
`rm` - remove
`ln` - create link
