# The Difference Between React Component, Element, and Instance

In my own word:

- React Component: could be of three types, declared as classes or functions:
  - Composite React Component, like `<App />`
  - Native Component: like `<div>`
  - String
- Element: pure object, describing the DOM nested tree.
- Instance: React component instances, where `setState` and the lify cycle hooks lives.
